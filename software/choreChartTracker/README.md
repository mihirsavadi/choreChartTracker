For some reason the platformIO IDE makes it a pain to get its project linker to 
look at files in anything besides the /src and the natively handles libraries in /.pio/libdeps. This is why the /src directory here has all the class source files bundles directly together with main.cpp - not clean, but not a big deal either since there isnt a lot of stuff. 

TODO: Fill out the rest readme for software documentation.
