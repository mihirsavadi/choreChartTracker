# choreChartTracker Software

For some reason the platformIO IDE makes it a pain to get its project linker to 
look at files in anything besides the /src and the natively handled libraries in /.pio/libdeps. This is why the /src directory here has all the source files that we wrote bundled directly together with main.cpp - not clean, but not a big deal either since there isnt a lot of stuff.

TODO: Fill out the rest readme for software documentation. Update method and class comments for Doxygen compatibility.
